BerlinUhr.hs
============

Berlin Uhr Kata implemented in Haskell, for the rules of the Kata, please [go here](http://content.codersdojo.org/code-kata-catalogue/berlin-clock/).

This implementation specifically ignores the "24:00:00" case, as this is an invalid time. The correct representation of this time is "00:00:00"
